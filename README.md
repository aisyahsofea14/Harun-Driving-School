# Harun-Driving-School
Semester 2 Java Project for Harun Driving School System (BlueJ)

Welcome to the Harun Driving School Registration System, a user-friendly Java program that streamlines the student registration process. This project was developed for the CSC186: Object-Oriented Programming coursework.
Project Overview
The Harun Driving School Registration System is designed to make registering for driving classes easier, faster, and more accurate. It reduces manual errors, securely manages student details, and automatically generates receipts and sales summaries for staff.

 ## Key Features
Register students for Car, Motorcycle, or Lorry licenses

1. Choose license code:
- D / DA (Car)
- B / B2 (Motorcycle)
- E (Lorry)
Add optional transportation service (RM50 extra)

2. Automatic calculation of:
License fees, Transportation charges

3. Generate:
Official receipts saved in receipt.txt, Staff summary of total students and sales

4. Input validation for:
License type
License code

5. Object-Oriented Programming concepts:
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstract classes
Encapsulation

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Java
- BlueJ (development)
- Text-based interface

## Sample Output
- Menu showing license prices
- Prompts for student details
- Official receipt saved to receipt.txt
- Staff summary report of total sales and student count

## How to Run
1️. Clone or download the repository.
2️. Open the .java files in your Java IDE.
3️. Compile all files
4. Run the main program
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to register students and generate receipts.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a Java program for managing driving school registrations
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Use abstract classes and method overriding to handle different license types
- Practice file writing to generate official receipts
- Improve data validation and error handling for user inputs

## File Structure
Student.java           // Holds student details
classLicense.java      // Abstract parent class for licenses
Car.java               // Subclass for Car license
Motorcycle.java        // Subclass for Motorcycle license
Lorry.java             // Subclass for Lorry license
ClassLicenseApp.java   // Main program with user input and receipt generation
